# Progression
This module offers a different take on progression. It handles content based on patches instead of brackets or by conquering content. It is server-wide and always the same for all players.

# Note
Keep in mind that it's not complete even if there seems to be a lot done. It's not meant to be 1:1 compared to retail because with changes to spells and so forth that's impossible without client and core edits, and those kind of edits are not what I want.

I haven't added the level 60 versions of Naxxramas yet and I'm not sure if I ever will. The event for opening the Gate of Ahn'Qiraj just requires a player to complete the line of quests required to obtain The Scepter of the Shifting Sands too. I have no plans to fully implement the War Effort event.

Wrath of the Lich King patches are by far the most complete and I am currently focusing on The Burning Crusade but I'm busy with other things a lot of the time.

# Corrections
Create issue reports for anything that isn't correct and I will look into it as soon as I have the time to. If something isn't intended to be in a certain patch, or if it is, I want to change it and would greatly appreciate reports for it.

The same can be said for improvements to the code. I'm not a professional developer in any way so it might not be clean or very optimized and therefore I welcome suggestions for that too.

# Pull Requests
I don't accept pull requests. There are a few exceptions listed below, and all of them have to be true for me to consider merging a pull request.
- It's something I *really* want or that I think should be included with the module.
- It matches my code style.
