# Progression
This module offers a different take on progression. It handles content based on phases instead of brackets or by conquering content. It is server-wide and always the same for all players.

# Phases
These are all the phases included with this module. Phase 0 through 6 simulates 1.12, 7 through 12 simulates 2.4, and 13 through 18 simulates 3.3.5. Each phase locks content in order to create progression. What each phase unlocks can be changed as this is not meant to mirror what Blizzard did with Classic

# Note
Keep in mind that it's not complete even if there seems to be a lot done. It's not meant to be 1:1 compared to retail because with changes to spells and so forth that's impossible without client and core edits, and those kind of edits are not what I want.

Phase 6 does include Naxxramas and the Scourge Invasion event but those are not implemented yet. I do plan to implement Naxxramas eventually but it's not high priority.

The event for opening the Gate of Ahn'Qiraj just requires a player to complete the line of quests required to obtain The Scepter of the Shifting Sands too. I have no plans to fully implement the War Effort event.

# Corrections
Create issue reports for anything that isn't correct and I will look into it as soon as I have the time to. If something isn't intended to be in a certain phase, or if it is, I want to change it and would greatly appreciate reports for it.

The same can be said for improvements to the code. I'm not a professional developer in any way so it might not be clean or very optimized and therefore I welcome suggestions for that too.

# Pull Requests
I don't accept pull requests. There are a few exceptions listed below, and all of them have to be true for me to consider merging a pull request.
- It's something I *really* want or that I think should be included with the module.
- It matches my code style.
