# Progression
This module offers a different take on progression. It handles content based on patches instead of brackets or by conquering content. It is server-wide and always the same for all players.

# Note
Keep in mind that it's not complete even if there seems to be a lot done. It's not meant to be 1:1 compared to retail because with changes to spells and so forth that's impossible without client and core edits, and those kind of edits are not what I want.

I haven't added the level 60 versions of Naxxramas and the opening of the Ahn'Qiraj event is a work in progress. I don't need reports for these unless specifically stated.

Wrath of the Lich King patches are by far the most complete and also my current focus. Changes have slowed down significantly because there's not much I can find that needs to be changed in those patches, and I'm also busy with other things a lot of the time. I will probably start to focus on The Burning Crusade patches soon.

# Corrections
Create issue reports for anything that isn't correct and I will look into it as soon as I have the time to. If something isn't intended to be in a certain patch, or if it is, I want to change it and would greatly appreciate reports for it.

The same can be said for improvements to the code. I'm not a professional developer in any way so it might not be clean or very optimized and therefore I welcome suggestions for that too.

# Pull Requests
I don't accept pull requests. There are a few exceptions listed below, and all of them have to be true for me to consider merging a pull request.
- It's something I *really* want or that I think should be included with the module.
- It matches my code style.
