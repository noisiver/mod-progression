# Note
Keep in mind that it's not complete even if there seems to be a lot done. It's not meant to be 1:1 compared to retail because with changes to spells and so forth that's impossible without client and core edits, and those kind of edits are not what I want.

# Corrections
Create issue reports for anything that isn't correct and I will look into it as soon as I have the time to. If something isn't intended to be in a certain patch, or if it is, I want to change it and would greatly appreciate reports for it.

The same can be said for improvements to the code. I'm not a professional developer in any way so it might not be clean or very optimized and therefore I welcome suggestions for that too.
